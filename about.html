        <p class="about">HELLO, I'M BONNIE. Prior to my current role, I was a teacher and mentor. Now I am a web developer, and I spend my time creating meaningful products that help people. Making the transition from teacher to student wasn't easy, but it has been an incredible journey. Glad to share it with you!
